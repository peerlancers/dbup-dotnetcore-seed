[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

This is a starter solution for creating database migration using [DbUp](https://dbup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and embedded sql scripts in .NET Core. You can use it to quickly create a database migration process by simply adding migrations scripts and providing database connection settings.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the `dbup-seed` repository.
2. Set your database connection parameters in the `environmentVariables` in the `DbUp.Migration.Runner` project.
3. Build the solution using Visual Studio
4. Run/Debug the `DbUp.Migration.Runner`.
